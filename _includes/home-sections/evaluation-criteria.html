		Evaluation Criteria
	</h3>
	<p class="mt-4">
		During this challenge, we’re excited to see ideas that:
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Focus on the Home, Care and Capability</strong>: Do the ideas propose new solutions to
		protect or improve the practices of our individual and collective privacy, and new ways of being at
		home together?
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Are Innovative</strong>: We're eager to think beyond the current structure of awareness and
		outdated technology surrounding media delivery and consumption. Do ideas bring something completely
		new to the field or ignite existing efforts in a new way?
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Consider Scale</strong>: Starting local can be really powerful – but how might ideas be
		transformed when deployed across a larger geographic region. We’re looking for mindfulness of the
		different structures that might challenge and constrain scaling up and how ideas might adapt as they
		grow.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Are mindful of diversity</strong>. How can your idea transform existing inequalities of
		representation and access to information, change relationships of care, and address differences of
		ability?
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Embrace Interactivity</strong>: The interaction should be iterative. Don’t just make a
		system where the user takes one action, the system responds, and it’s over. Make a system where the
		user sees the system’s response, and takes more action in response, in a continued loop.
