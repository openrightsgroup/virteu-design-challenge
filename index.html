			<!--intro-->
			<div class="col-10 col-md-8 mt-3">
				<p class="lead">
					For years we have heard that the ‘smart home’ is coming, using connected devices to
					transform
					everyday life.
				</p>
				<p>Personal assistants, remotely-triggered thermostats, responsive lighting and cooking,
					cleaning and food preparation apps and services promise to make our individual lives better by
					personalising aspects of the environments and information around us.
				</p>

				<p>
					While this personalisation happens, another important trend changes what home is and who is
					there.
					Younger people live longer with their parents, or return to their homes after study. People of
					all
					ages experiment with collaborative living and share spaces and experiences. Families change
					shape,
					and some people at home need extra care to accommodate age, illness or different abilities.
				</p>

				<p>
					These issues of difference and care challenge the idea that connected systems are just for
					personal
					use. We share our space, our information and our devices in complex ways, even as we simply try
					to
					get through ‘ordinary life at home’. How might connected Internet of Things (IoT) systems and
					products enter into and change communal spaces of home?

					Evaluation Criteria
				</h3>
				<p class="mt-4">
					During this challenge, we’re excited to see ideas that:
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Focus on the Home, Care and Capability</strong>: Do the ideas propose new solutions to
					protect or improve the practices of our individual and collective privacy, and new ways of being at
					home together?
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Are Innovative</strong>: We're eager to think beyond the current structure of awareness and
					outdated technology surrounding media delivery and consumption. Do ideas bring something completely
					new to the field or ignite existing efforts in a new way?
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Consider Scale</strong>: Starting local can be really powerful – but how might ideas be
					transformed when deployed across a larger geographic region. We’re looking for mindfulness of the
					different structures that might challenge and constrain scaling up and how ideas might adapt as they
					grow.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Are mindful of diversity</strong>. How can your idea transform existing inequalities of
					representation and access to information, change relationships of care, and address differences of
					ability?
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Embrace Interactivity</strong>: The interaction should be iterative. Don’t just make a
					system where the user takes one action, the system responds, and it’s over. Make a system where the
					user sees the system’s response, and takes more action in response, in a continued loop.
