				<p>For years we have heard that the &lsquo;smart home&rsquo; is coming, using connected
					devices to transform everyday life. Personal assistants, remotely-triggered thermostats, responsive
					lighting
					and cooking, cleaning and food preparation apps and services promise to make our individual lives
					better by
					personalising aspects of the environments and information around us.</p>

				<p>While this personalisation happens, another important trend changes what home is and
					who is there. Younger people live longer with their parents, or return to their homes after study.
					People of
					all ages experiment with collaborative living and share spaces and experiences. Families change
					shape, and
					some people at home need extra care to accommodate age, illness or different abilities.</p>

				<p>These issues of difference and care challenge the idea that connected systems are
					just for personal use. We share our space, our information and our devices in complex ways, even as
					we
					simply try to get through &lsquo;ordinary life at home&rsquo;. How might connected Internet of
					Things (IoT)
					systems and products enter into and change communal spaces of home?</p>
				<h2 class="mt-4">The big question</h2>
				<p>Living together in all our differences, is part of our present and will shape our
					futures.</p>

				<p>How might we use connected Internet of Things systems and products to re-imagine
					collaborative and communal living that is sensitive to differences between members of these living
					spaces?</p>
				<h2 class="mt-4">What we are looking for</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Early stage designs that use connected IoT systems and products to explore new
						ways of living together</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li>Ideas about how to balance personalisation, privacy, and the experience with the
						interests and preferences of different people who live together</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li>Creative interventions in using connected devices to provide for life together,
						not only as individuals</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 class="mt-4">Prizes</h2>
				<p>One winning team will win &euro;XXX and one runner-up team will win &euro;XXX. The
					winners and runners-up will be invited to London with accommodation and travel paid for. They will
					present
					their concept to the ORGCon conference on Saturday 13 July, where they will also receive one hour of
					1-to-1
					mentoring from an IoT industry leader.</p>
				<h2 class="mt-4">Design constraints</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>This challenge is for concepts around IoT in the home</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li>The home users are families, groups or individuals who live together</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li>The concept addresses or reflects on challenges or consequences of connected
						life</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li>The concept should interface with at least one conception of
						&lsquo;difference&rsquo; as outlined above and through the personae</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li>Take into account how your connected IoT product or system would interface with
						at least one of these aspects of difference:</li>

					<ul>
						<li>Language</li>
						<li>Intercultural</li>
						<li>Intergenerational</li>
						<li>Ability and capability</li>
						<li>Socio-economic status</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>

				<h2 class="mt-4">Submission material</h2>
				<p>For the first stage of the challenge, we ask that you submit:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>A short description of the idea: what does it do, how will it be used, who
						exactly is it for? What problem does it solve?</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li>A scenario: write or draw a storyboard of how this will be used in a possible scenario
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>To participate in this design challenge, you should prepare and submit your ideas at a stage of
					having a clear concept but are low fidelity in terms of physicality.</p>
				<h2 class="mt-4">Personae</h2>
				<p>To provide some inspiration around the ways that you might think about living at
					home, with difference, here are some sample personae. You don&rsquo;t have to design only for them
					but
					perhaps these sketches will help to provide some sparks for thinking about the ways in which the
					idea of
					home is changing, and how connected IoT products might play new roles in these communal spaces.
					Unlike most
					personae, these are of groups of people who live together in different ways, rather than
					individuals.
				</p>
				<h3>Sara, Marco and Xian</h3>
				<p>Sara, Marco and Xian all share a large house. They are all between their mid-20s and
					mid-30s. Sara and Xian are working, Marco has gone back to university for postgraduate training.
					They are
					all single and dating, but their home life is important, even though they were not friends before
					they moved
					in. They want to share music, files and expenses, and really enjoy having collective dinners and
					parties
					that they all contribute to. But they also would like to keep some parts of their lives private from
					each
					other. They each have a different mother language and grew up with different cultural practices
					around food,
					space and privacy. </p>
				<h3>The Farooqs</h3>
				<p>Lisa and Mohammed Farooq have two small children and both work full time. Recently
					Mohammed&rsquo;s mother Lutfun moved in with them since she is becoming elderly, and also to help
					care for
					the kids. She and Mohammed share a language that they are teaching to the children, but Lisa
					doesn&rsquo;t
					speak it. Lutfun doesn&rsquo;t see very well but is very independent and also wants to help with the
					children. </p>
				<h3>The Stevens</h3>
				<p>Anabel and Todd Stevens live with their son Barney. Barney suffered an mountain
					climbing accident over his gap year and needs some help with daily tasks due to his injuries, which
					have
					also prevented him from beginning university, although he would like to go. The whole family are
					eager
					technology users.</p>
				<h3>Molly, Mia and Mo</h3>
				<p>Molly lives with her lodger Mo, who is really nice but sometimes struggles to make
					ends meet. Her daughter Mia splits her time between Molly&rsquo;s house and her dad&rsquo;s home,
					which is
					on the other side of town. Molly wants Mo to feel at home, but also tries to keep her family life
					separate.
					Mia takes her homework between Molly&rsquo;s place and her dad&rsquo;s, and both parents try to keep
					on top
					of helping organise activities as well as get Mia to them. </p>
				<h2 class="mt-4">Evaluation Criteria</h2>
				<p>During this challenge, we&rsquo;re excited to see ideas that:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Do the ideas
						propose new solutions to protect or improve the practices of our individual and collective
						privacy, and
						new ways of being at home together?</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li>We&#39;re eager to think beyond the
						current structure of awareness and outdated technology surrounding media delivery and
						consumption. Do
						ideas bring something completely new to the field or ignite existing efforts in a new way? </li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li>Starting local can be really powerful
						&ndash; but how might ideas be transformed when deployed across a larger geographic region.
						We&rsquo;re
						looking for mindfulness of the different structures that might challenge and constrain scaling
						up and
						how ideas might adapt as they grow.</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li>How can your idea transform
						existing inequalities of representation and access to information, change relationships of care,
						and
						address differences of ability?</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li>The interaction should be
						iterative. Don&rsquo;t just make a system where the user takes one action, the system responds,
						and
						it&rsquo;s over. Make a system where the user sees the system&rsquo;s response, and takes more
						action in
						response, in a continued loop.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 class="mt-4">Related materials</h2>
				<ul>

						possible for devices (&lsquo;things&rsquo;) to read, gauge and understand consumers at
						unprecedented
						levels. Sensors measure physical inputs and transform them into raw data, which is then
						digitally
						storable for access and analysis.&rdquo; ( <a
